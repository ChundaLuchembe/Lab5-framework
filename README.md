## Part 1 â€“ Bootstrap
- Implemented a responsive layout with navbar, two-column layout, styled button, and alert
- Used only Bootstrap CDN and its built-in classes

## Part 2 â€“ Tailwind CSS
- Built a responsive card layout using Tailwind utility classes
- No custom CSS used â€“ relied on classes like `bg-white`, `text-xl`, `rounded`, `hover:bg-blue-600`, etc.

## Part 3 â€“ React.js
- Created an interactive component using functional React
- Used `props` to accept a user name
- Used `useState()` to toggle visibility of a message
